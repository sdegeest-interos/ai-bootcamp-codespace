## 📋 Typical Workflow

### Initial Setup
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
poetry install

# 2. Curate ground truth
poetry run streamlit run evals/inspect_ground_truth.py -- --input evals/ground_truth_evidently.csv
# Select good questions → export to evals/gt-curated.csv
```

### Run Evaluation
```bash
# 3. Sample questions
poetry run python -m evals.sample_ground_truth \
    --sample-size 25 \
    --input evals/gt-curated.csv \
    --output evals/gt-sample.csv

# 4. Run evaluation
poetry run python -m evals.eval_orchestrator --csv evals/gt-sample.csv
```

### Analyze Results
```bash
# 5. Inspect results
poetry run streamlit run evals/inspect_eval_results.py
# Review, filter, identify issues
```

### Iterate
```bash
# 6. Fix issues in code/prompts
# 7. Re-run evaluation with same sample
poetry run python -m evals.eval_orchestrator --csv evals/gt-sample.csv

# 8. Compare results in inspector

## 💡 Tips

### Ground Truth Inspector
- Use "Show only selected" to review your selections before exporting
- Search for specific topics to focus curation
- Edit questions to make them clearer or more specific
- Original questions are preserved in "Show original"
- View source lines to understand context of each question
- Verify question quality by checking the source material
- Use metadata badges (difficulty, intent) to filter questions

### Evaluation Results Inspector
- Start with summary metrics to get overview
- Use "Show only potential issues" for quick problem identification
- Sort by tool calls or answer length to find extremes
- Compare tool call patterns across results
- Export filtered results for offline analysis
- Use search to find results about specific topics

### Both Tools
- Both tools preserve your work in session state
- Browser refresh will reset selections/filters
- Export frequently to save your work
- Run from project root directory
